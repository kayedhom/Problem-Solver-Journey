# Problem Solving Journey

Welcome to my repository of HackerRank solutions! Here, you'll find my attempts at solving various coding challenges. I might not have all the answers, but I'm learning one problem at a time. Feel free to take a look—just don’t judge my variable names too harshly!

## Contents

This repository contains solutions to various problems on HackerRank. The solutions are organized by problem category:

- **Algorithms**
- **Data Structures**
- **Mathematics**
- **AI**
- **Databases**
- **Regex**

## How to Use

Each folder contains a set of problems, with each problem having its own folder. Inside each problem folder, you'll find:

- The problem statement (`problem.md`)
- My solution (`solution.py` or other relevant file extension)
- Any additional notes or explanations (`notes.md`)

## Getting Started

To run the solutions locally, make sure you have the relevant programming language installed. For most of these solutions, you'll need Python. You can run a solution by navigating to its folder and executing the script. For example:

```bash
cd algorithms/some_problem
python solution.py

```

## Contributing
If you have suggestions for improvements or find any bugs, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always open to learning and improving!

## Acknowledgments
A big thank you to the HackerRank community for providing such interesting and challenging problems to solve.
