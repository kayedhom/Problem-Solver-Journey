The purpose of the provided code is to determine the number of distinct integers in a sequence generated by a specific formula. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the logic:

1. Input Reading: The code reads four integers \( N \), \( S \), \( P \), and \( Q \), which are used to generate the sequence.

2. Modulo Operation: The code uses \( \text{mod} = 2^{31} \) to ensure that all calculations remain within the bounds of a 32-bit signed integer.

3. Sequence Generation: The first element of the sequence is initialized to \( S \% \text{mod} \). Subsequent elements are generated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{current} = (\text{current} \times P + Q) \% \text{mod}
   \]

4. Cycle Detection: The code detects if the sequence starts to repeat by checking if the newly generated number matches any previously generated number. If it does, it breaks out of the loop.

5. Counting Distinct Elements: The code keeps a counter to count how many unique numbers are generated before a repeat is detected.

6. Output: Finally, the code outputs the count of distinct numbers in the sequence.

The purpose of this logic is to efficiently determine the number of unique integers in potentially large sequences without exceeding memory limits or processing time. The approach ensures that the solution avoids using memory-intensive data structures like vectors or sets.
